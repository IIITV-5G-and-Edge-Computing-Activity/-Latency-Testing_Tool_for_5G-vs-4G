## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Real-World Wireless Communication Dataset** to compare the performance of 4G and 5G technologies across various metrics such as latency, bandwidth, and device density. The analysis employs various visualization tools like Bokeh, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Real-World Wireless Communication Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddss/real-world-wireless-communication-dataset)
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Real-World QOS Dateset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omarsobhy14/5g-quality-of-service)
- **Description:** 
  - This dataset contains real-world metrics for wireless technologies. 
  - Key parameters:
    - **Latency (ms):** Time taken to send and receive data packets.
    - **Bandwidth (Gbps):** Data transmission capacity.
    - **Device Density:** Number of devices supported per square kilometer.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are created:
1. **Grouped Bar Plot (Bokeh):** Compares 4G and 5G metrics for better performance insights.
2. **Heatmap (Seaborn):** Shows differences between the metrics in a compact visual format.
3. **Interactive Bar Plot (Plotly):** Enables user interaction to analyze trends dynamically.
4. **Matplotlib Static Bar Plot:** Provides a straightforward visualization for quick comparisons.
